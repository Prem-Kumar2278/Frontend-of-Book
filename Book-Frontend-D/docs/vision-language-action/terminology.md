# Terminology: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

## Core Concepts

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Integrated system architecture that connects visual perception, language understanding, and action execution in robotics.

### Language Understanding
Processing of human language input (voice or text) to extract actionable intent for robotic systems.

### Intent Recognition
The process of identifying the underlying goal or purpose behind a human command or request.

### Cognitive Planning
High-level reasoning process that decomposes complex goals into sequences of executable actions.

### Goal-to-Action Decomposition
Method of breaking down high-level objectives into specific, executable steps for robotic systems.

### High-Level Control
Abstract reasoning and planning layer that determines what actions to take based on goals and context.

### Low-Level Control
Implementation layer that executes specific motor commands and motion planning for robotic actuators.

### End-to-End System Flow
Complete pathway from initial language input through perception processing to final action execution.

### Failure Modes
Specific ways in which autonomous systems can fail to execute intended behaviors correctly.

### Constraint Handling
Management of physical, computational, and environmental limitations in robotic systems.

## Technical Terms

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Computational approach to understanding and generating human language.

### Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
Technology that converts spoken language to text.

### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
Process of extracting meaning and intent from natural language input.

### Vision-Language Models (VLM)
AI systems that can process both visual and textual inputs simultaneously.

### Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)
Method for training models to understand relationships between language and visual concepts.

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
Step-by-step logical reasoning process used by large language models.

### Task and Motion Planning
Integration of high-level task planning with low-level motion planning for robotics.

### Symbolic-Subsymbolic Integration
Combination of symbolic reasoning (rules, logic) with subsymbolic processing (neural networks).

### Three-Layer Architecture
Robot control architecture with behavior, planning, and learning layers.

### Subsumption Architecture
Layered control system where higher layers can inhibit lower layers' behaviors.

Timing requirements that robotic systems must meet for responsive operation.

### Multimodal Fusion
Process of combining information from multiple sensory modalities.

### Wake Word Detection
Technology to activate voice-controlled systems with specific trigger words.

### Context Resolution
Using environmental and conversational context to clarify ambiguous commands.

### Confirmation Strategies
Methods for verifying unclear commands with human users.

### Fallback Mechanisms
Alternative approaches activated when primary methods fail.

### Behavior Cloning
Learning approach where robots learn by imitating human demonstrations.

### Reinforcement Learning
Learning through trial and error with reward-based feedback.

### Imitation Learning
Approach to learning by copying expert behavior.

### World Models
Internal representations that robots use to understand and predict environmental dynamics.
