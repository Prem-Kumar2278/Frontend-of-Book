# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics TextBook

Welcome to the comprehensive curriculum on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**! This textbook explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and physical robotics, focusing on how AI systems connect with and control physical robot bodies.

## About This TextBook

This comprehensive curriculum is designed for intermediate AI and Python learners who want to understand how digital intelligence connects with physical robot behavior. The textbook is organized into four progressive modules:

### Module 1: Physical AI & Robotics Foundations
- **ROS 2 Foundations**: How robotic middleware enables communication between different components
- **AI-Robot Communication**: How artificial intelligence connects with robot controllers
- **Humanoid Modeling with URDF**: How physical robot structure impacts intelligence and behavior

### Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation
- **Physics Simulation Foundations**: Gravity, collisions, constraints and simulation realism
- **Environment Design & Interaction**: Virtual worlds for training and human-robot interaction
- **Sensor Simulation & Perception**: LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs and sensor realism

### Module 3: AI-Robot Brain
- **Photorealistic Simulation & Synthetic Data**: Closing the reality gap with synthetic data
- **Localization & Mapping**: Visual SLAM concepts and spatial awareness
- **Navigation & Motion Planning**: Path planning basics and bipedal movement constraints

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- **Language Understanding**: LLMs for robotic applications
- **LLM-Based Cognitive Planning**: AI-driven decision making for robots
- **Autonomous Humanoid Capstone**: Integrating perception, cognition, and action

## Getting Started

Begin with [Module 1: Physical AI & Robotics Foundations](./physical-ai-robotics/intro) to establish the foundational concepts, then progress through each module in sequence to build your comprehensive understanding of how AI systems connect with physical robots.

Each module includes learning objectives, conceptual explanations, real-world relevance examples, and key takeaways to reinforce your understanding.

## Learning Approach

The textbook takes a conceptual approach without requiring hands-on hardware or coding. You'll focus on understanding the fundamental principles that govern how AI systems interact with physical robots, using clear analogies and architectural explanations.

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Basic Python knowledge
- Familiarity with system architecture concepts
- No prior robotics experience required
