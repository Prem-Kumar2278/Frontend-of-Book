# Control Hierarchy Architecture in LLM-Driven Robotic Systems

## Overview
This diagram shows the hierarchical control structure that separates high-level reasoning from low-level execution in LLM-driven robotic systems.

## Hierarchy Levels

### Level 1: Cognitive Planning (High-Level)
- LLM-based goal decomposition
- Task planning and sequencing
- Strategic decision making
- Human interaction and communication
- Long-term goal management
- Interfaces with: Natural language input, world model, task queue

### Level 2: Task and Motion Planning (Mid-Level)
- Path planning and navigation
- Manipulation planning
- Obstacle avoidance planning
- Resource allocation
- Temporal coordination
- Interfaces with: Cognitive planner, motion controllers, perception

### Level 3: Execution Control (Low-Level)
- Motor command generation
- Real-time sensor processing
- Reactive behaviors
- Balance and stability control
- Safety interlocks
- Interfaces with: Hardware actuators, sensors, safety systems

## Information Flow

### Downward Flow (Commands)
- High-level goals → Mid-level tasks → Low-level commands
- Plan specifications with constraints
- Execution parameters and tolerances

### Upward Flow (Feedback)
- Execution status and progress
- Environmental changes and obstacles
- Error conditions and exceptions
- Resource availability updates

### Lateral Flow (Coordination)
- Perception data sharing
- World model synchronization
- Resource conflict resolution
- Safety state sharing

## Integration Points
- Language interface at cognitive level
- Perception integration across all levels
- Safety systems at all levels
- Human feedback mechanisms

## Coordination Mechanisms
- State synchronization protocols
- Plan update procedures
- Exception handling routines
- Resource management protocols

## Key Features
- Clear separation of concerns
- Appropriate abstraction levels
- Robust communication protocols
- Failure isolation capabilities
- Scalable design principles
