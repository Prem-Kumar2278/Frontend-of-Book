# Goal Decomposition Process in LLM-Based Robotic Planning

## Overview
This diagram illustrates how large language models decompose high-level goals into executable robotic actions, showing the hierarchical planning process.

## Decomposition Stages

### Stage 1: Goal Analysis
- High-level objective input (natural language)
- Constraint identification
- Feasibility assessment
- Resource requirement estimation
- Output: Structured goal representation

### Stage 2: Subgoal Generation
- Task breakdown using LLM reasoning
- Prerequisite identification
- Dependency mapping
- Alternative approach consideration
- Output: Set of subgoals with relationships

### Stage 3: Action Sequencing
- Temporal ordering of subgoals
- Resource allocation planning
- Conflict resolution
- Critical path identification
- Output: Ordered action sequence

### Stage 4: Constraint Integration
- Physical capability constraints
- Environmental constraints
- Safety constraints
- Temporal constraints
- Output: Feasible action plan

### Stage 5: Execution Validation
- Plan feasibility check
- Safety verification
- Resource availability confirmation
- Risk assessment
- Output: Validated executable plan

## LLM Integration Points
- Natural language goal interpretation
- Common-sense reasoning application
- Knowledge base utilization
- Analogical reasoning for novel situations

## Feedback Mechanisms
- Plan execution monitoring
- Deviation detection and correction
- Learning from execution outcomes
- Strategy refinement

## Hierarchical Structure
- High-level goals (what to achieve)
- Mid-level tasks (how to approach)
- Low-level actions (specific motor commands)

## Key Considerations
- Maintain plan flexibility for environmental changes
- Balance optimality with computational efficiency
- Ensure safety throughout decomposition process
- Support plan revision based on execution feedback
