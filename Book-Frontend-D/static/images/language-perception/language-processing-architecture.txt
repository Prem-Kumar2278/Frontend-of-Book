# Language Processing Architecture for Robotics

## Overview
This diagram illustrates the architecture of language processing systems in robotics, showing how voice input is transformed into actionable intent.

## Components

### Input Layer
- Microphone array for audio capture
- Audio preprocessing for noise reduction
- Wake word detection system

### Processing Layer
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Intent extraction module
- Context management system

### Integration Layer
- World model interface
- Perception system coordination
- Action space mapping
- Plan validation

## Data Flow
1. Audio input → Preprocessing → Wake word detection
2. Wake word activation → ASR → Text output
3. Text input → NLU → Intent extraction
4. Intent + Context → Action mapping → Executable commands

## Key Features
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Noise tolerance and acoustic adaptation
- Context-aware intent resolution
- Multi-modal integration potential
- Safety and validation checks

## Integration Points
- Connection to perception systems for object reference resolution
- Link to planning systems for action decomposition
- Feedback loops for disambiguation
- Safety systems for command validation
