# Intent Recognition Flow in Robotic Systems

## Overview
This diagram shows the process flow for recognizing user intent from natural language commands in robotic systems, highlighting the steps from raw speech to actionable intent.

## Process Stages

### Stage 1: Speech Input and Recognition
- Raw audio capture
- Speech-to-text conversion
- Text normalization
- Output: Recognized text with confidence scores

### Stage 2: Natural Language Understanding
- Named entity recognition
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Syntactic parsing
- Semantic analysis
- Output: Structured representation of the utterance

### Stage 3: Intent Classification
- Intent type identification (e.g., navigation, manipulation, information)
- Entity linking to world model
- Command structure analysis
- Output: Classified intent with parameters

### Stage 4: Context Integration
- Conversational context incorporation
- Environmental context integration
- User preference consideration
- Ambiguity resolution
- Output: Disambiguated intent with full context

### Stage 5: Action Mapping
- Intent to executable action translation
- Constraint checking against robot capabilities
- Feasibility validation
- Output: Executable command sequence

## Feedback Loops
- Disambiguation requests to user
- Context updates from perception
- Execution feedback to intent refinement

## Error Handling
- Confidence threshold checking
- Fallback to clarification requests
- Graceful degradation for uncertain inputs
- Recovery from misrecognition

## Key Considerations
- Real-time processing requirements
- Ambiguity tolerance and resolution
- Multi-turn dialogue support
- Robustness to speech recognition errors
