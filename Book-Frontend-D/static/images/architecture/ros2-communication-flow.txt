# ROS 2 Communication Flow - Architecture Sketch

## High-Level Architecture

Robot System
├── Sensors (Camera, LiDAR, IMU, etc.)
│   └── Publish data to Topics
├── AI Processing Nodes
│   ├── Perception Node
│   ├── Planning Node
│   └── Decision Node
├── Control Nodes
│   ├── Path Following
│   └── Motor Control
└── Actuators (Motors, Grippers, etc.)

## Communication Patterns

### Topic Communication (Publish-Subscribe)
Sensors → /sensor_data_topic → Perception Node
Perception → /detected_objects_topic → Planning Node
Planning → /commands_topic → Control Nodes

### Service Communication (Request-Response)
External App → /navigation_service → Path Planning (Request: "Go to X", Response: "Path calculated")

### Action Communication (Goal-Feedback-Result)
Navigation System → /move_to_goal_action → Base Controller
├── Goal: "Move to position X,Y"
├── Feedback: "Progress: 30% to goal"
└── Result: "Successfully reached goal"

## Nervous System Analogy

Brain (AI Algorithms) ↔ Spinal Cord (ROS 2 Middleware) ↔ Body (Sensors & Actuators)
├── Sensory Pathway: Sensors → ROS 2 → AI
└── Motor Pathway: AI → ROS 2 → Actuators
