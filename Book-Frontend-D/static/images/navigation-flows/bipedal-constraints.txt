# Bipedal Locomotion Constraints Diagram

## Overview
This diagram illustrates the specific constraints and challenges associated with bipedal movement in humanoid robot navigation, showing:
- Balance and stability requirements
- Dynamic walking vs static walking constraints
- Step planning limitations
- Gait pattern considerations

## Key Constraints

### Balance Constraints
- Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) limitations
- Center of Mass (CoM) positioning requirements
- Support polygon constraints
- Dynamic balance during movement

### Kinematic Constraints
- Joint angle limits
- Step length restrictions
- Step width limitations
- Swing leg trajectory planning

### Dynamic Constraints
- Ground reaction forces
- Inertial forces during movement
- Acceleration limits
- Angular momentum considerations

### Environmental Constraints
- Terrain adaptability
- Surface friction requirements
- Obstacle clearance needs
- Foot placement restrictions

## Impact on Navigation Planning
- Path planning must account for balance maintenance
- Turning radius limitations due to bipedal mechanics
- Speed variations based on terrain complexity
- Recovery strategies for disturbances
