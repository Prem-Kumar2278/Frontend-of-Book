# Path Planning Basics Diagram

## Overview
This diagram illustrates the fundamental concepts of path planning for humanoid robots, showing:
- The relationship between global path planning and local path planning
- Different path planning approaches (sampling-based vs optimization-based)
- Key considerations for humanoid-specific navigation

## Components
- Start and goal positions
- Obstacle representation
- Feasible path candidates
- Optimal path selection
- Humanoid-specific constraints

## Process Flow
1. Environmental mapping and obstacle detection
2. Global path planning (topological route)
3. Local path planning (collision avoidance)
4. Path optimization considering humanoid dynamics
5. Execution with feedback control

## Humanoid-Specific Considerations
- Balance constraints during movement
- Step location planning for bipedal locomotion
- ZMP (Zero-Moment Point) trajectory planning
- Gait pattern adaptation based on terrain
