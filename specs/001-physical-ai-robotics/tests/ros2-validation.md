# ROS 2 Concepts Content Validation Checklist

Use this checklist to validate the technical accuracy and completeness of ROS 2 Foundations content.

## Core ROS 2 Concepts

- [ ] Explanation of why robots need middleware is clear and accurate
- [ ] Definition of ROS 2 as the "robot's nervous system" is appropriately explained
- [ ] Nodes concept is clearly defined and explained
- [ ] Topics concept is clearly defined and explained
- [ ] Services concept is clearly defined and explained
- [ ] Actions concept is clearly defined and explained
- [ ] Differences between topics, services, and actions are clearly articulated
- [ ] Communication patterns (asynchronous vs synchronous vs goal-oriented) are explained

## Technical Accuracy

- [ ] All information is consistent with official ROS 2 documentation
- [ ] No implementation details or code examples are included (conceptual focus only)
- [ ] All architectural concepts are accurately represented
- [ ] Communication flow diagrams accurately represent ROS 2 patterns

## Learning Assessment Criteria

- [ ] Learner can explain why robots need middleware after reading this content
- [ ] Learner can identify nodes, topics, services, and actions in a system diagram
- [ ] Learner can articulate the role of ROS 2 as a nervous system for robots
- [ ] Learner understands the communication challenges that ROS 2 addresses

## Content Quality
