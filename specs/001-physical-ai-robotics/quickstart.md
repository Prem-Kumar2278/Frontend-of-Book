# Quickstart: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Module

## Overview
This module introduces intermediate AI and Python learners to the concepts of embodied AI through ROS 2 middleware, AI-robot communication, and humanoid modeling. No hands-on hardware or coding is required - this is a conceptual exploration of how AI systems connect with physical robots.

## Prerequisites
- Intermediate understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Basic Python knowledge
- Familiarity with system architecture concepts
- No prior robotics experience required

## Getting Started

### 1. Chapter 1: ROS 2 Foundations
Start with understanding why robots need middleware and how ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" of robotic systems.
- Read about nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Study the architecture sketches showing communication flows
- Understand how this enables distributed robotic systems

### 2. Chapter 2: AI-Robot Communication
Explore how AI decision-making connects to robot controllers.
- Learn about Python agents as bridges between AI and control
- Understand real-time vs non-real-time communication requirements
- Study conceptual diagrams of AI-agent ↔ robot controller interactions

### 3. Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF
Discover how humanoid robots are represented digitally.
- Understand links, joints, and sensors in URDF
- Learn how physical structure impacts intelligence
- Explore the relationship between morphology and cognitive capabilities

## Learning Path
1. Begin with Chapter 1 to establish foundational concepts
2. Progress to Chapter 2 to understand AI-robot integration
3. Complete with Chapter 3 to grasp physical embodiment
4. Review all takeaways to consolidate understanding

## Expected Outcomes
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain how AI connects to physical robot behavior
- Describe simulation-to-reality (sim2real) workflows
- Trace data flow from sensors → AI → actions
- Understand the role of ROS 2 in embodied AI systems

## Resources
- Architecture sketches and conceptual diagrams are provided throughout
- Each chapter includes learning objectives and key takeaways
- Consistent terminology is maintained across all chapters
- Real-world relevance examples connect concepts to practical applications
