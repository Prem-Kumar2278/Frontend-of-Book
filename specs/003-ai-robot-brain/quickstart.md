# Quickstart Guide: AI-Robot Brain Module

## Overview
This module introduces intermediate AI and Python learners to advanced perception and navigation for humanoid robots using the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. You'll learn about photorealistic simulation, localization and mapping with visual SLAM, and navigation with motion planning concepts.

## Prerequisites
- Intermediate understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Basic Python knowledge
- Familiarity with system architecture concepts
- No prior robotics experience required

## Getting Started

### 1. Chapter 1: Photorealistic Simulation & Synthetic Data
Start with understanding how photorealistic simulation generates synthetic data to train robots effectively.
- Learn about synthetic data generation techniques
- Understand reality gap closure methods
- Explore how simulation accelerates robot development

### 2. Chapter 2: Localization & Mapping
Explore how robots understand their position in space using visual SLAM concepts.
- Study spatial awareness principles
- Learn about acceleration techniques for spatial processing
- Understand how robots create and update environmental maps

### 3. Chapter 3: Navigation & Motion Planning
Discover how robots plan paths and execute movement with bipedal constraints.
- Learn path planning fundamentals
- Understand constraints specific to humanoid locomotion
- Explore how motion planning integrates with perception

## Learning Path
1. Begin with Chapter 1 to establish simulation and synthetic data foundations
