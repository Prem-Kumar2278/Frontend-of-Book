Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — AI Systems in the Physical World

Target Audience:

Intermediate AI and Python learners with minimal robotics background, preparing for advanced embodied AI and humanoid robotics work.

Focus:

Bridging digital AI intelligence with physical robotic bodies through simulation, perception, planning, and control. Emphasis on embodied intelligence, system architecture, and real-world constraints.

Primary Goal:

Enable learners to conceptually understand and design AI-driven humanoid robot systems that perceive, reason, plan, and act in simulated and real environments.

Success Criteria:

- module contains exactly 3 cohesive chapters

- Readers can explain how AI connects to physical robot behavior

- Clear understanding of simulation-to-reality (sim2real) workflows

- Conceptual mastery of ROS 2, simulation, perception, and planning

- Learners can mentally trace data flow from sensors → AI → actions

Book Structure:

- Module 1

- module 1 contains 3 chapters

- Each chapter includes:

  - Learning objectives

  - Conceptual explanations

  - System architecture descriptions

  - Real-world relevance
